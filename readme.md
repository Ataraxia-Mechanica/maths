A C++11+ linear algebra library I am using for multiple projects. 

It contains templated vector, matrix and quaternion structures with all the appropriate overloaded operators, functions and an assortment of intersection tests and utility functions.

Everyone has their own maths library and there are numerous freely available C++ maths libraries which already exist, but developing and maintaining this library has given me a lot of insight into 3D mathematics and the finer details of modern C++ by utilising features such as explicit template specialisation, enable_if, anonymous structs inside unions among others.

A 3D interactive demo of the intersection functions used for debugging and testing purposes can be found in my other repository [pmtech](https://github.com/polymonster/pmtech).
