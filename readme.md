A C++11+ linear algebra library I am using for multiple projects. 

It contains templated vector, matrix and quaternion structures with all the appropriate overloaded operators, functions and an assortment of intersection tests and utility functions.

Everyone has their own maths library and there are numerous freely available C++ maths library which already exist, so I have written about my motivations behind this project [here](http://www.polymonster.co.uk/articles.html)

A 3D interactive demo of the intersection functions used for debugging and testing purposes can be found in my other repository [pmtech](https://github.com/polymonster/pmtech).
