A C++ linear algebra library I am using for multiple projects. 

It contains templated vector, matrix and quaternion with all the appropriate overloaded operators, functions and an assortment of intersection tests and utility functions.

Everyone has their own maths library and there are numerous freely available C++ maths libraries which already exist, this is just mine that I collected over the years, some of the code has come from different sources.

A 3D interactive demo of the intersection functions used for debugging and testing purposes can be found in my other repository [pmtech](https://github.com/polymonster/pmtech).
