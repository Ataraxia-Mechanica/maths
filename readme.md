A C++ linear algebra library I am using for multiple projects. 

It contains templated vector, matrix and quaternion overloaded operators, functions and an assortment of intersection tests and utility functions. Shader style swizzles are also supported on vectors!

All of the intersection and test functions are based on matrix, vectors and quaternions, there is no "plane", "aabb" or "frustum" types to keep things primitive.

A 3D interactive demo of the intersection functions used for debugging and testing purposes can be found in my other repository [pmtech](https://github.com/polymonster/pmtech).
